# Especially useful when the caps lock key is remapped and you accidentally use it

# Windows remote desktop RDP also always captures your input with admin rights and
# changes your caps lock state even when running kbremap on your remote machine.

[layers]
# A layer is a collection of mappings where each mapping consists of a *source* (`scan_code`) and a
# *target* (e.g. characters, modifiers keys, ...).
#
# Scan codes are used as source to specify the behaviour of a physical key on the keyboard.
# Reference: <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Ps2_de_keyboard_scancode_set_1.svg>
#
# Scan codes without explicit mapping will use the default Windows layout to translate
# a key press to a [virtual key code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes).
#
# Use the debug output to observe scan code (sc) and virtual key code (vk) information while pressing keys.

    # so that keyborad shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl+a) continue to work as expected.
