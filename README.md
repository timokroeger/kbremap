# `kbremap`

Custom keyboard layouts for Windows.

`config.toml` is a well-commented example configuration for the Dvorak layout.

## Features
* Remap any key to any other key
* Supports Unicode characters, including most Emojis ‚å®Ô∏èüî•
* Virtual layers (e.g., right alt to overlay arrow keys for navigation)
* No installation or administrator rights required
* Double-click on tray icon disables the layout
* Option to run at Windows system startup
* Uses the Windows low-level keyboard hook for maximum compatibility

## Features `neo.toml` configuration
* Supports all 6 layers of the [Neo-Layout](https://neo-layout.org/)
* Support for dead keys on Layers 1 and 2 (Pull Requests for Layers 3-6 are welcome)
* Optional QWERTY/QWERTZ layout for shortcuts with CTRL, ALT, and WIN modifiers

## Known issues
* Does not work for RDP in full-screen mode (or when "Apply Windows key combinations:
  On the remote computer" is set). Using a second instance of kbremap on the remote
  machine works fine as workaround.
* Compose key not avaible (yet)
